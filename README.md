# A very simple project showing most common features of SASS.

## How to run the project

- Check the package.json file. It has a sass-watch script.
- First run `npm sass-watch` script to automatically compile sass to css into the ./css/ folder. In our case, we are compiling the index.scss file into style.css file which is referenced in index.html
- Finally, either open the index.html file in a browswer manually or use something like live-server (plugin in VS code) to run the index html file in the browser.
